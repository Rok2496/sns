                Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and
                manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software.
                Just like people, software robots can do things like understand what's on a screen, complete the
                right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined
                actions. But software robots can do it faster and more consistently than people, without the need to
                get up and stretch or take a coffee break.
